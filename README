Contentment
===========

Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp, <hanenkamp@cpan.org>

Contentment is a content management system. It was originally designed to help
maintain knowledge base information related to a systems support ste and
information related to a course site.

The system is generally intended to be easy to use and easy to code.
Optimization and scalability have not been major goals at this point. It
provides a fairly straightforward way of creating a web site through file-based
pages and adds theming, indexing, dynamic page generation, and format
transformation with very little effort.

INSTALLATION

For complete installation instructions, see the documentation of
Contentment::Manual::Install. You may do this via:

  perldoc lib/Contentment/Manual/Install.pm

Basic installation is via the typical Module::Build formula:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

If you have Apache::Test installed and run into trouble while testing because
Apache::Test asks for locations of httpd and apxs and bugs out, the solution is
to run:

  t/TEST_APACHE

and wait for it to start the web server. You can either let the tests run or
Ctrl+C at this point and then again run:

  ./Build test

This is the work-around until I can find the root problem and disarm it.
