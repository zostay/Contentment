Contentment
===========

Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp, <hanenkamp@cpan.org>

Contentment is a content management system. It was originally designed to help
maintain knowledge base information related to a systems support ste and
information related to a course site.

The system is generally intended to be easy to use and easy to code.
Optimization and scalability have not been major goals at this point. It
provides a fairly straightforward way of creating a web site through file-based
pages and adds theming, indexing, dynamic page generation, and format
transformation with very little effort.
